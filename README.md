# bank-pin
* Source: Helping a friend with CS 159 homework (supposed to be in C, but this is using Java)
* Description: Simple program for testing new bank pin so that the digits of the original pin and new pin don't line up. Operators (if, etc.) are not allowed. The *when* operator is used for efficency but can be typed out.
